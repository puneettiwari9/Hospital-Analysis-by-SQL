# Hospital-Analysis-by-SQL
SQL queries and database structure to analyze hospital data using PostgreSQL

This project presents a comprehensive SQL-based analysis of hospital data using PostgreSQL. It simulates real-world healthcare reporting by extracting insights from hospital records like patient statistics, department workloads, hospital stay durations, and medical expense tracking.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Understand the patient distribution across hospitals and departments
- Analyze hospital performance metrics (e.g., doctors/patients ratio)
- Track medical expenses on a hospital and monthly basis
- Evaluate operational efficiency by analyzing stay durations and workloads

## 🗃️ Table Structure

The project uses one main table: `public.hospital`

```sql
CREATE TABLE public.hospital (
  hospital_name TEXT,
  location TEXT,
  department TEXT,
  doctors_count INTEGER,
  patients_count INTEGER,
  admission_date DATE,
  discharge_date DATE,
  medical_expenses NUMERIC(10,2)
);
---

##📥 Data Import Command

---To import your CSV file (update the file path to your system):

sql
Copy
Edit
COPY public.hospital (
  hospital_name, location, department,
  doctors_count, patients_count,
  admission_date, discharge_date,
  medical_expenses
)
FROM 'path'
DELIMITER ','
CSV HEADER;
